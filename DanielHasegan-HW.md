# Computational Homework 

I am submitting this as homework for Rigor & Reproducibility (001) course. 

I have been using git/github for a long time now. I have a few projects on my public repository and I have been using git for work since 2014. For example, I use github for my website at: [daniel.hasegan.com](https://daniel.hasegan.com).
