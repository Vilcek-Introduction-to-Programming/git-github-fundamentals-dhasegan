# Computational Homework 

I am submitting this as homework for Rigor & Reproducibility (001) course. 

I have been using git/github for a long time now. I have a few projects on my public repository and I have been using git for work since 2014. For example, I use github for my website at: [daniel.hasegan.com](https://daniel.hasegan.com).

There are many useful ways that Github helps with reproducibility practices, as defined by Wilson et al.:

- First of all, Github is a repository for all the changes happening to the codebase. They implement easy access and visualization for commits and branches. And collaboration on projects through pull-requests is seamless. 
- Just by using `Git` in the background, all commits have a SHA that uniquely identifies the change and it's place in the repository. This is great for versioning. Similarly, one could use git TAGS to annotate specific commits with versions. This helps with project releases.
- Features like Github actions ([link](https://github.com/features/actions)) can automate the workflow of your project to compile and run tests. Moreover, I have multiple projects that update automatically and update my websites (i.e., building continuous integration of code into production).
- Regarding using documents and "to-do" lists to improve collaboration, Github offers wikipedia pages and issues that open source communities rely on to collaborate and create code together.
- Github offers to create Licenses for Open source code directly at project creation time.

In conclusion, Github helps with the "Keeping track of changes" and "Collaboration" aspects of the project. The other aspects like "Data organization", "Software", and "Project organization" is up to the author to use as practices. Github is flexible enough to allow good or bad practices in those latter categories and Github doesn't enforce any practices. Usually, as open source projects evolve over time, they converge to good practices as the developers need to create those practices for the benefit of the community.
